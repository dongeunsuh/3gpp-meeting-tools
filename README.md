# 3gpp-meeting-tools
A set of tools to ease the execution of 3GPP meetings

The purpose of this project is to facilitate the actual
work of 3GPP SA2 delegates by automating certain
repetitive tasks caused by the meeting procedures. This includes:

* Searching of TDocs in the folder structure combining web locations, 
a local repository and a local inbox folder where contributions are 
uploaded on-the-fly
* Searching of the last agenda file in the meeting folder structure 
(both local and remote)
* Caching TDocs for offline use/review in an ordered local file structure
* Merging of TDoc comments from different colleagues to form a 
consolidated list that can be used by the delegate during the meeting
* Automaticly sorting of eMeeting and email approval m
